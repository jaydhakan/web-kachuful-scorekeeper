# Kachuful backend: build plan

_For the backend repo. Written 2026-10-31 from decisions made with Jay. The frontend has its own plan (`plan-frontend.md` in the app repo). **§6, the API contract, is shared by both and must not change without updating both plans.**_

## 1. What we are building

Kachuful is a mobile-first scorekeeper for the Judgement / Kachuful card game (`https://play.vectanix.com`). One phone or tablet scores the whole table. It is a React PWA that works fully offline, keeps everything in the browser, and has no backend today.

This backend adds:

- **Invite-only accounts.** There is no sign-up: one seeded admin invites people.
- **Sync.** A signed-in scorer's games, history and players are stored on the server.
- **A global player registry** with unique names.
- **Leaderboards, stats, achievements, daily awards and monthly seasons**, computed by the server from the rounds.
- **Live table links and shareable recaps** that anyone with the link can open.

The app stays **offline-first**: the phone is the source of truth while playing and syncs when it can. A signed-out phone never talks to the server.

| Leaderboard ranking  | **Default sort: average points per round** (total points ÷ rounds; shown as a whole number, ranked on the exact value). Players are **ranked only with more than N rounds in the range**: N = 10 for Today, 25 for Last 7 days, 50 for This month, Last month and All time. A custom range uses the N for its length (≤ 1 day → 10, ≤ 7 days → 25, longer → 50). Everyone else is listed **unranked and greyed out below the ranked players**, sorted the same way. The minimum applies to rate metrics (average, accuracy, win rate); count metrics (points, wins, games, rounds, best round, longest run) rank everyone. |
| Player names         | **Globally unique, case-insensitive** (spaces collapsed). Adding an existing name asks "Is this the same Riya?". Yes links to that player; No means choosing a different name.

## 4. Architecture

```
Browser (PWA at play.vectanix.com)
   │  same-origin fetch, cookie session, header X-Kachuful: 1 on writes
   ▼
nginx ── /            → static app (/var/www/play)       (unchanged)
      ├─ /api/        → FastAPI 127.0.0.1:8000           (proxy_buffering off for */events)
      └─ /r/  /l/     → FastAPI (preview HTML for WhatsApp, then redirect into the app)
FastAPI
   ├─ auth        sessions, invites, resets, rate limits
   ├─ admin       users, invites, reset links, player merge
   ├─ players     registry, name check, profiles, stats, head-to-head
   ├─ games       upload (PUT), validate, derive, list, links
   ├─ boards      leaderboard, daily awards, seasons, wrapped, activity
   ├─ public      live JSON + SSE, recap JSON, OG image, preview pages
   └─ domain/     pure Python port of the app's rules + stats + achievements (golden-fixture tested)
PostgreSQL (games stored whole as JSON + derived tables for fast queries)
```

**Rule:** `domain/` is pure. It has no database or FastAPI imports and is just functions over the game JSON, mirroring the app's TypeScript `src/domain`. Every derived number comes from it.

```

- `name_key = lower(collapse_spaces(trim(display_name)))`, the same function as the app's.
- Indexes:
  - `round_scores (done_at)` and `(player_id, done_at)`
  - `game_players (player_id)`
  - `games (ended_at)` and `(updated_at)`
  - `achievements (player_id, earned_at)` and `(code, period)`
  - `activity (created_at desc)`
- Tokens (invite, reset, session) are random 32 bytes, url-safe. Only their **SHA-256 is stored**. Share-link tokens are stored plain: they are capabilities the owner needs to show again as a QR code.
- `game_players` and `round_scores` are **rebuilt from `payload` inside the same transaction** as every game upload.

### 5.2 The game payload (wire format; exactly the app's `Game`, plus sync fields)

```jsonc
{
  "id": "6f1c…uuid", // stable sync id
  "rev": 12, // increments on every local change (undo included)
  "schemaVersion": 3,
  "createdAt": 1761900000000, // epoch ms
  "updatedAt": 1761903600000,
  "finishedAt": null, // epoch ms when the game ended in the app
  "status": "active", // 'active' | 'finished'
  "direction": "cw", // 'cw' | 'ccw' (seat layout only)
  "firstDealerIndex": 0,
  "decks": 1, // 1 | 2
  "maxCards": 10,
  "lengthMode": "endless", // 'endless' | '1cycle' | '2cycles'
  "players": [
    { "id": "p0", "playerId": "uuid", "name": "Riya", "emoji": "🦊", "color": "#ff8a65" },
  ],
  "rounds": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "cards": 3,
      "trump": "spades",
      "dealerIndex": 0,
      "firstPlayerIndex": 1,
      "bids": { "p0": 1 },
      "results": { "p0": "made" },
      "tricks": null,
      "hookHits": 0,
      "phase": "done",
      "doneAt": 1761900300000,
    },
  ],
  "ui": { "view": "round", "bidIdx": 0 }, // app-only; store it, ignore it
}
```

- `players[].id` is the **game-local** id that `bids`, `results` and `tricks` are keyed by. `players[].playerId` is the **registry** id.
- Games from before this release have no `doneAt` on rounds and no `finishedAt`. For those, use `updatedAt` as the time of every round and of the finish.

---

## 6. API contract (shared with the frontend)

General rules:

- **Paths:** everything under `/api`. JSON bodies, `camelCase` fields, times in **epoch milliseconds**, ids are UUID strings.
- **Auth:** a cookie named **`kf_session`** (`HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Path=/`).
  - Every non-GET request must carry the header **`X-Kachuful: 1`** and a same-site `Origin`. Anything else gets `403 {code:"csrf"}`.
- **Errors:** `{ "code": "snake_case", "message": "human text", ...extra }` with the right status.
  - Common codes: `unauthenticated` (401), `forbidden` (403), `not_found` (404), `gone` (410, used or expired token), `invalid` (422, with `fields`), `rate_limited` (429, with `retryAfter`).
- **Lists:** cursor pagination as `?cursor=…&limit=…` (default 50, max 200), answered as `{ items: [...], nextCursor: string|null }`.
- **Ranges:** `from` and `to` are epoch ms, half-open `[from, to)`. The client works them out in the viewer's timezone.

```ts
User = { id, email, role: 'admin'|'member', playerId: string|null, createdAt }

```

Notes:

- When accepting an invite, the player is either an existing registry player (`{id}`, which must not already be linked to another user) or a new one.
- If the invite was created with a `playerId`, the client sends that id.
- **Password validation:** `len >= 3 and len <= 128 and not re.search(r"\s", pw)`. Otherwise `422 weak_password`.

Upload rules for `PUT /api/games/{id}`:

1. **Stale check:**
   - `rev` ≤ stored `rev` and the payload hash differs → `409 stale {server: payload}`.
   - The same hash → `200` with nothing earned (an idempotent retry).
2. **Permissions:** the first upload sets `owner_id`. Later uploads are allowed for the owner or an admin; anyone else gets `403`.
3. **Unknown players:** every `players[].playerId` must exist (after following `merged_into`), or `422 unknown_player {playerIds}`. Merged ids are rewritten to the target in the stored payload, and the response then includes `remap: {old: new}`.
4. **Validation (§7.2):** a failure is `422 invalid_game {reason, roundIndex?}`.
5. **Store and derive:** store the payload, rebuild the derived rows, recompute achievements for the players in this game (§8), and set `ended_at`.
6. **After commit:** write `activity` rows and run `NOTIFY live_<gameId>`.

A row is `qualified` when `rounds > minRounds`. For rate metrics (`avgPerRound, accuracy, winRate`): qualified rows come first with ranks, then unqualified rows with `rank: null`; both are sorted by `value` desc, ties broken by points, then rounds. For count metrics every row is qualified. `value` is exact (`avgPerRound` = points ÷ rounds as a float; the app rounds it for display). Ties on the exact value share a rank (1, 1, 3). `rankDelta` compares with the previous window of the same length (null when unranked in either). Supports `ETag` / `If-None-Match` (§15). |

## 7. Domain port (Python `domain/`)

The app's rules live in TypeScript (`src/domain`). The backend reimplements exactly what it needs as pure functions. **Parity is proven by golden fixtures exported from the app** (§12.1). When a fixture and the code disagree, the fixture wins, and both teams are told.

### 7.1 Rules to port

- `TRUMPS = ['spades','diamonds','clubs','hearts']`; the trump of round `i` is `TRUMPS[i % 4]`.
- `max_for(n, decks) = min(10, floor(52*decks/n))`. Players: 3–7 with one deck, 3–10 with two.
- `cycle_len(max) = 2*(max-2)`. `cards_for(i, max)`: with `p = i % cycle_len`, return `3+p if p < max-2 else max-(p-(max-2))`. This gives 3 → max → 3, with max and 3 each repeated once.
- Round `i`: dealer `= (firstDealerIndex + i) % n`; first player `= (dealer + 1) % n`. Bid order runs from the first player round the table to the dealer.
- Total rounds: endless = ∞; `1cycle` = `cycle_len`; `2cycles` = `2*cycle_len`.
- **Score:** `v = max(bid, 1) * 10`. Made `+v`, missed `-v`. A game total is the sum over done rounds. Totals are never stored in the payload.
- **Dealer's hook:** the dealer may not bid `cards - sum(other bids)` when that is between 0 and `cards`. So in a done round, `sum(bids) != cards`. (`hookHits` counts the dealer's attempts to bid the blocked number.)
- **Results must add up** (`fits`): with `left = cards - sum(bids of made)`, `left >= 0` is required. Then `left` tricks must be shareable among the players who missed so that none of them wins exactly their own bid. Port `shareOut` (a subset-sum over 0..left excluding each bid).
- **Exact tricks (optional):** if `tricks` is present, `sum == cards`, each `0..cards`, and `results[p] == 'made'` iff `tricks[p] == bids[p]`.
- **Places:** competition ranking on totals (1, 1, 3); ties keep seat order for display.

### 7.2 Upload validation (each failure has a `reason` code)

| Reason        | Check                                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `players`     | 3–10 players, decks-compatible, unique local ids, unique `playerId`s, names 1–14 characters                                    |
| `max_cards`   | `maxCards == max_for(n, decks)`                                                                                                |
| `round_plan`  | `index`, `cards`, `trump`, `dealerIndex` and `firstPlayerIndex` match the formulas for every round                             |
| `round_order` | Only the last round may be unfinished. No more rounds than `lengthMode` allows. `status = finished` requires every round done. |
| `bids`        | In a done round every player has an integer bid `0..cards`, and `sum != cards`                                                 |
| `results`     | In a done round every player has `made`/`missed` and `fits()` holds                                                            |
| `tricks`      | As in §7.1                                                                                                                     |
| `times`       | `createdAt ≤ doneAt ≤ updatedAt + 5 min`, and nothing more than 10 min in the future (server time)                             |

### 7.3 Derivation on every upload

- **`round_scores`**, one row per player per done round. `run_hot` and `run_cold` are the current made and missed run lengths **within that game** after that round.
- **`game_players`**: totals, place (only once the game has ended), `won` (place 1, ties included), made/missed, best/worst round, longest runs, and the hook hits charged to them as dealer.
- **`ended_at`** is `finishedAt` (or `updatedAt` for legacy games) when `status = finished`. Otherwise it is null, until auto-end sets it.

## 8. Achievements, awards, seasons, wrapped

The app shows the same catalogue live during play (from its own TypeScript engine); the server is the record. Codes, names and emoji are shared: the app renders names from `code`, and the server uses them in previews and the activity feed.

- **"Made"** means made the bid in a round; **"run"** means consecutive done rounds within one game.
- Ties earn together.
- Each row is earned at most once per `(player, code, game, round, period)`.

A timer at 00:05 `APP_TZ` finalises the day before. During the day, `GET /api/awards/daily` computes awards on the fly.

### 8.5 Seasons and Wrapped

- **Seasons** are calendar months in `APP_TZ`; points come from round `done_at`. Standings use the default board rule: average points per round, and a player qualifies with **more than 50 rounds** that month. Awards (qualified players only):
  - `season_champion` 👑, `season_runner_up` 🥈, `season_third` 🥉
  - `season_sharpest` 🎯 (accuracy, minimum 30 rounds)
  - `season_iron` 🦾 (most games)
  - `season_climber` 📈 (biggest rank rise compared with last month; must qualify in both)
- A timer on the 1st at 00:10 closes the previous month and writes the awards and an activity row. The current month is live.
- **Wrapped** (`GET /api/wrapped/{year}/{playerId}`):
  - Totals, best month, best day, favourite trump (best accuracy), nemesis (most losses against) and best partner (most games together).
  - Biggest round, longest run, achievements earned, the top 3 days by rounds, and a rank among all players.
  - It is plain JSON; the app animates it as story slides.

### 8.6 Recompute strategy

- **On upload:** recompute round and game achievements for that game. Recompute career achievements for its players, which is cheap with per-player SQL over `game_players` / `round_scores`.
- **On merge, delete or auto-end:** recompute career achievements for the affected players. Delete rows that no longer hold (an edit can un-earn something) and keep the ones that still do (stable `earned_at`).
- `earned` in the upload response lists only rows **inserted** by that upload. The app uses it for the activity feed and to update badges on other devices; live celebrations come from the app's own engine.

## 10. Security

- argon2id with library defaults. Constant-time token comparison via hashes. Generic login errors (`bad_credentials` for both a wrong email and a wrong password).
- **Rate limits** (Postgres `rate_limits`):
  - Login: 10 per 10 min per IP, and 10 per 10 min per email.
  - Token endpoints: 30 per 10 min per IP.
  - `PUT /games`: 120 per minute per user.
- **CSRF:** `SameSite=Lax`, plus the `X-Kachuful: 1` header, plus an `Origin` check on every non-GET request.
- **Sessions:** 180-day rolling expiry, refreshed at most once a day. Logout, password change and deactivation revoke sessions.
- **Public endpoints** never return emails, first/last names or user ids, only display names, emoji and colours.
- Request size limit 1 MB; JSON depth limits; all SQL through SQLAlchemy.
- Security headers come from nginx. CSP is unchanged for the app; `/r/` and `/l/` pages are static.
- **Logs:** structured JSON, with no passwords, tokens or cookies in them.

---

## 11. Deploy and run

```nginx
# inside the existing server block for play.vectanix.com
location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    client_max_body_size 1m;
}
location ~ ^/api/public/live/[^/]+/events$ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_read_timeout 1h;
    proxy_set_header Connection '';
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
}
location ~ ^/(r|l)/ { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000; }
```

- **systemd:** `kachuful-api.service` (uvicorn with `--proxy-headers`), plus timers for the jobs in §9.
- **Environment:** `DATABASE_URL`, `APP_ORIGIN=https://play.vectanix.com`, `APP_TZ=Asia/Kolkata`, `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL=jaydhakan11@gmail.com`, `SESSION_DAYS=180`, `BACKUP_REMOTE`, `OG_CACHE_DIR`, `LOG_LEVEL`.
- **Environments:** local (Docker Compose Postgres), **staging** (`staging.play.vectanix.com` or a port on the same VPS, with its own database), production.
- **Migrations:** `alembic upgrade head` runs in the deploy job before the restart. Every migration is reversible or has a written rollback note.
- **Health:** `GET /api/health` returns `{ok, db, version}` for an uptime monitor.
- **Fonts for OG images:** Bricolage Grotesque and DM Sans (the app's fonts) plus Noto Color Emoji, bundled in the repo.

## 12. Testing

### 12.1 Golden fixtures (parity with the app)

The app repo exports `contract/fixtures/*.json`, which is committed to this repo under `tests/fixtures/` and refreshed when the app's rules change. Each fixture is one of:

- `{ kind: 'game', name, game, expect: { valid, reason?, totals, places, gamePlayers, roundScores, achievements } }`
- `{ kind: 'set', name, games, tz, expect: { leaderboard: {...per metric/range}, daily, season, career } }`

A parametrised pytest asserts the Python `domain/` reproduces every expectation exactly. **Until the first export arrives**, write fixtures by hand from §7–§8 and replace them when the real ones land.

### 12.2 Other tests

- **API tests:** httpx against the app with a real Postgres (transaction per test). Every endpoint, every error code, every permission rule.
- **Property tests (`hypothesis`):** random valid games always validate; any single corrupted field gets the right `reason`.
- **Concurrency:** two uploads of the same game at once → one wins, the other gets `409 stale`, and no duplicate derived rows.
- **SSE:** a viewer connected before an upload receives the `game` event, and revoking a link sends `revoked`.
- **Load sanity:** the leaderboard for a year of data (about 50 players, 5,000 games) answers in < 150 ms with the indexes.

---

## 13. Milestones (build in this order; each ends green and deployed to staging)

1. **B0. Skeleton:** repo, `uv`, FastAPI app, settings, Docker Compose Postgres, Alembic, CI, `GET /api/health`, deploy to staging behind nginx.
2. **B1. Auth + admin:** users, sessions, login/logout/me, `seed-admin`, invites, resets, admin users screen API, password rule, rate limits, CSRF.
3. **B2. Players:** registry, `name_key` uniqueness, check, create (idempotent), patch permissions, merge.
4. **B3. Games:** `PUT` with stale/idempotency checks, storage, `GET` list and detail, delete. Validation with hand-written fixtures.
5. **B4. Domain port + derived tables:** `round_scores`, `game_players`, `ended_at`, `auto-end`. Swap in the app's golden fixtures once they arrive.
6. **B5. Boards:** `player_day` rollups, leaderboard (all metrics, ranges, the ranked/unranked rule, rank deltas, ETags), player stats, player games, calendar, head-to-head, `bootstrap`.
7. **B6. Achievements:** the full catalogue in §8.1–8.3, recompute strategy, `earned` in the upload response, achievements list, activity feed.
8. **B7. Daily, seasons, Wrapped:** close-day and close-season jobs and endpoints, Wrapped.
9. **B8. Live + recap:** share links, SSE fan-out via `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, public endpoints, OG image, QR SVG, `/r` and `/l` pages.
10. **B9. Hardening:** backup job and a rehearsed restore, prune, security headers check, load sanity, production deploy, and `seed-admin` on production.
11. **B10. Handoff:** write `HANDOFF.md` (§16) and run the performance checks in §15 against staging with the load dataset. Tell Jay it's ready.

Hand-offs to the frontend: B1 unblocks sign-in screens, B2 the name dialog, B3/B4 sync, B5–B7 boards, B8 sharing. Keep staging running with seed data (`python -m app.cli seed-demo`) so the app can test against it.

---

## 14. Working agreement

- **The contract in §6 is frozen** once B1 starts. Changes need a note to Jay and an update to both plans.
- Never store or log plain tokens or passwords.
- Every endpoint gets tests before it is called done.
- Say plainly when something is stubbed, mocked or unverified.
- Conventional Commits, one concern each. Don't push or touch CI/production unless Jay asks.
- Project standards live in this repo's `CLAUDE.md`; follow them.

## 15. Performance (the app must feel instant)

The app renders from its own IndexedDB cache first and refreshes in the background. The server's job is to answer every refresh fast and to send nothing when nothing has changed.

### 15.1 Budgets (p95 server time on staging, with the load dataset of 50 players, 5,000 games and about 80,000 rounds)

| Endpoint                        | Budget                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/auth/me`, `bootstrap` | 30 ms / 80 ms                                                 |
| `PUT /api/games/{id}`           | 120 ms, including derive and achievements                     |
| `GET /api/leaderboard`          | 60 ms (any range, any metric)                                 |
| Player page calls               | 80 ms each                                                    |
| `GET /api/games` (list)         | 50 ms                                                         |
| Live update                     | under 300 ms from `PUT` to the viewer receiving the SSE event |
| Any `304 Not Modified`          | 10 ms                                                         |

### 15.2 Indexes (each comes with a test that runs `EXPLAIN` on the real query and asserts the index is used)

### 15.3 Precompute on write, never on read

- **Every upload** rebuilds, in one transaction:
  - `round_scores` and `game_players` for that game.
  - `games.summary`: list endpoints read this and never parse `payload`.
  - `player_day` rows for the days the game touches. A day is rebuilt by summing that day's `round_scores`, so edits and undo stay correct.
- **Leaderboards over whole `APP_TZ` days** (Today, 7 days, months, All time, and any custom range on day boundaries) read `player_day` only. Ranges that cut through a day read `round_scores` for the partial edge days and `player_day` for the rest.
- **Closed days and seasons are immutable.** Their awards are stored and served with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`.

### 15.4 Cache and transfer

- A global **`data_version`** counter (one row) is bumped by every upload, delete, merge or auto-end. Read endpoints send `ETag: "<data_version>-<params hash>"` and answer `304` to a matching `If-None-Match` before touching other tables.
- An in-process LRU (per worker, 30 s TTL, keyed by ETag) holds leaderboard, awards and player responses. No Redis.
- nginx: `gzip on; gzip_types application/json image/svg+xml;`, HTTP/2, keep-alive.
- Database:
  - asyncpg pool of 10 per worker.
  - Prepared statements on.
  - `statement_timeout = 2s` for API requests, 60 s for jobs.
- **No N+1 queries:** a request makes a fixed number of queries whatever the data size (tests assert the query count on the main endpoints).
- SSE: **one `LISTEN` connection per worker** feeds every subscriber on that worker from memory. Each event is the summary plus the payload, once.
- Postgres tuning for a small VPS: `shared_buffers` about 25% of RAM, `effective_cache_size` about 60%, `work_mem` 16 MB, `random_page_cost` 1.1 on SSD. Autovacuum stays on.

### 15.5 Proving it

- `python -m app.cli seed-load` builds the load dataset on staging.
- `tests/perf/` (marked `perf`, run on demand) measures p95 for each endpoint in §15.1 and fails over budget.
- The numbers go into `HANDOFF.md`.

---

## 16. Handoff to the frontend (`HANDOFF.md`)

Start `HANDOFF.md` at B1 and update it at the end of every milestone. When B10 is done it must let the frontend verify everything **without reading the backend code**:

1. **Status table:** every endpoint in §6, marked done / tested / deviations (and why). Any approved contract change, with its date.
2. **Environments:** staging and production base URLs, how to reset staging (`seed-demo`, `seed-load`), and the deployed version (`GET /api/health`).
3. **Test accounts on staging:** an admin and two members with known passwords, plus a pending invite link and a reset link to try.
4. **Copy-paste checks:** `curl` commands with a cookie jar for every flow:
   - log in, `bootstrap`, create a player, a name clash
   - upload a game, then a stale upload
   - leaderboard with an ETag `304`
   - live SSE (`curl -N`)
   - recap OG image
5. **Rules as built:** rate-limit numbers, session length, password rule, timezone handling, auto-end timing, the leaderboard minimum-rounds table.
6. **Parity:** which `contract/fixtures` version is checked in and that all of it passes (or exactly which cases fail).
7. **Performance:** measured p95 per endpoint against §15.1, with the dataset size.
8. **Known gaps and follow-ups**, said plainly.
